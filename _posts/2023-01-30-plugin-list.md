title: Starting the Plugin List
---

Recently a new feature was launched: a central plugin list.

### TLDR

The Plugin List is managed by the [InvenTree org](https://github.com/inventree) and [open for submissions](https://github.com/inventree/inventree-website#adding-a-plugin-to-the-list). It is a simple list for now. Beeing on the list is now an endorsement by the core team.
