---

The InvenTree team is very excited to announce the InvenTree **0.9.0 Stable Release**!

This release is the culmination of many hours of work from multiple developers, providing numerous new features and bug fixes. We extend our thanks to the contributors who have helped on this release, as well as the users who have suggested new features or helped us track down outstanding software issues.

## New Features

The 0.9.0 release introduces many new features - some of the major ones are outlined briefly below:

### Installer

We now have a packaged command-line installer for simplified setup (on supported platforms), using the [packager.io](https://packager.io/) service. The installer is targetted for users who are installing InvenTree on a bare metal system (separate installers are available for container environments).

You can find more information about the installer at [docs.inventree.org](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/start/installer/).

### Backup and Restore

Database backup and restore functionality has been improved, using the [dbbackup library](https://django-dbbackup.readthedocs.io/en/master/). A backup of database records (and uploaded media files) can be performed with a simple command line action. Backup can also be configured to occur periodically, serviced by the background worker.
